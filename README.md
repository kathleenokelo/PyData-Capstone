# Social Buzz Data Analysis Project

Social Buzz is a rapidly growing tech unicorn with over 500 million users monthly that needs help to adapt to its massive global reach. Started in 2008, the app was created with an aim to revolutionize social media norms by focusing more on the content itself rather than the user hence giving content the center stage. 
Accenture has started a 3-month proof of concept focusing on three key areas: 
>-Auditing Social Buzz's big data practices

>-Providing recommendations for a successful IPO

>-Analyzing data to identify the company's most popular categories, content types and their trends
